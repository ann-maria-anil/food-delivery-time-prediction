# Food Delivery Time Prediction 🍔🚴‍♂️

This project predicts food delivery time using machine learning 
based on distance, preparation time, traffic, weather, and order details.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Streamlit
- Scikit-learn
- Gradient Boosting Regression

## How to Run the Project
1. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Run the app:
   streamlit run app.py

## Model Details
- Model: Gradient Boosting Regressor
- Input: Order, traffic, weather, and time-based features
- Output: Estimated delivery time (minutes)
